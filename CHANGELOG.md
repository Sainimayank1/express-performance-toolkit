## [2.4.0] — In Development

### ✨ New Features

- **Internalized Dashboard Routing** — The dashboard is now automatically mounted inside the toolkit middleware. Users no longer need to manually mount `toolkit.dashboardRouter`. A single `app.use(toolkit.middleware)` handles everything.
- **Request Tracing**: Inject unique correlation IDs into headers and logs for distributed tracing.
- **Top-Level Health Check Endpoint**: Extracted from the dashboard. Lightweight `/health` for monitoring and liveness/readiness probes. Independent of dashboard authentication.
- **Dashboard Theme Toggle**: Seamlessly switch between Premium Dark and Clean Light modes via the new Sun/Moon toggle.
- **Restored `store` and `cache` on `ToolkitInstance`** — The public API now exposes `toolkit.store` (for direct metrics access) and `toolkit.cache` (for manual cache control like `toolkit.cache.clear()`).
- **Redis-Backed Rate Limiting** — The rate limiter now supports optional Redis persistence (via the `redis` config option), allowing rate limit state to survive process restarts and be shared across cluster nodes. Fault tolerant: gracefully falls back to in-memory if Redis is unavailable.
- **Prometheus Metrics Export** — Expose application and system metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `/ept/metrics` (configurable). This enables integration with Grafana, Datadog, and more.
- **Smart Webhook / Alert Notifications** — Edge-triggered HTTP alerts when metric thresholds are breached (response time, memory, CPU, etc.). Fires exactly once per breach to prevent alert fatigue, and resets after recovery. Supports any HTTP endpoint via a unified `webhooks` array. Each entry can be a plain URL (generic JSON POST) or a `WebhookConfig` object with a `format` of `'slack'` (Block Kit), `'discord'` (Embed), or `'generic'`. Includes custom `onAlert` callback and `>=`/`<=`/`<`/`>` comparators.
### ⚡ Performance

- **O(1) Circular Buffers** — Replaced `Array.push()`/`Array.shift()` ring buffers in `MetricsStore` with index-based circular buffers for `logs`, `blockedEvents`, and `compressedEvents`. This eliminates O(n) array copies on every request at high throughput.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **`DashboardOptions.auth` accepts `null`** — You can now pass `auth: null` to explicitly disable dashboard authentication without TypeScript errors. Previously required `@ts-expect-error` workarounds.
- **Session Store isolation** — Moved `sessionStore` from module-level singleton into `createDashboardRouter()`. Each toolkit instance now gets its own isolated session store, preventing session leaks between instances.
- **Linting & Formatting** — Resolved all ESLint and Prettier violations across `src/` and `tests/`.

### 🔨 Breaking Changes

- **`ToolkitInstance` interface changed** — `dashboardRouter` is no longer exposed. Use the `dashboard.path` config option (default: `/ept`) to control where the dashboard is served. Migration:

```diff
- app.use(toolkit.middleware);
- app.use("/ept", toolkit.dashboardRouter);
+ app.use(toolkit.middleware); // Dashboard auto-mounted at /ept
```
